      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Social media gives people power to share information quickly. But like in the past, information is still sometimes hidden or censored. This site explores the history of censorship from the Chernobyl disaster to today’s digital age.</p>

      <h2>The Chernobyl Disaster and Censorship</h2>
      <p>In 1986, a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded. The Soviet government tried to hide the accident from the public. People continued living normally even as radiation spread. The government controlled the media, and people were punished for telling the truth.</p>

    <section id="modern">
      <h2>Modern Social Media and Censorship</h2>
      <p>Today, social media helps people speak out, organize protests, and share news. But some governments and companies still control what is shown. Posts about topics like protests, COVID-19, or elections can be removed or hidden. This creates new problems about who controls the truth online.</p>

      <h2>Comparing Then and Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Then:</strong> The Soviet Union censored the news to protect its image after Chernobyl.</li>
        <li><strong>Now:</strong> Governments and platforms censor content to fight misinformation or control political messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Both:</strong> Censorship can cause harm by hiding facts and creating confusion.</li>
      </ul>
